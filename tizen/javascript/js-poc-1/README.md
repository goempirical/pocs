# Tizen with Webpack

This project setup has multiple benefits

* we can use imports because we are bundling all the scripts together
* we can use async/await
* we can compile and then deploy to tizen(npm run build)
* we can run the app in the dev server on chrome (npm run start|restart)
* then we can open the tizen folder in the tizen Editor to validate
